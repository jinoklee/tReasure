# tReasure
__________
tReasure (tRna Expression Analysis Software Utilizing R for Easy use) is user-friendly tool for the analysis of deep-sequencing experiments for small RNAs using R packages. The tool requires a simple input file containing a list of unique reads. Using these data, tReasure (i) detects all known tRNA sequences annotated in GtRNAdb, (ii) predicts the specific expressed tRNA compare to control.

tReasure currently automates the following tasks:
