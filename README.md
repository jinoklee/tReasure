# tReasure
tReasure (tRna Expression Analysis Software Utilizing R for Easy use) is user-friendly tool for the tRNA expression analysis of deep-sequencing experiments for small RNAs using R packages. 

    tReasure currently implements the following tasks:
    1) Making sample list for analysis
    2) Pre-processing of trimming adapter and filtering reads
    3) Alignment and quantification
    4) Statistical analysis for differentially expressed tRNAs gene
    5) Visualization
