# tReasure
__________
tReasure (tRna Expression Analysis Software Utilizing R for Easy use) is user-friendly tool for the analysis of deep-sequencing experiments for small RNAs using R packages. The tool requires a simple input file containing a list of unique reads. Using these data, tReasure (i) detects all known tRNA sequences annotated in GtRNAdb, (ii) predicts the specific expressed tRNA compare to control.

## Installation guide
tReasure is a package for the R computing environment and it is assumed that you have already installed R. See the R project at (http://www.r-project.org). tReasure requires the gwidget2 graphical library to run and a few additional packages for the analysis of RNA-seq.
